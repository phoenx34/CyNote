<a>We implemented our relationships in springboot, so when we generated the EER diagram, the relationships did not show up. As a result, we had to add the relationships to the diagram. Hence, we have a few duplicate values for the foreign key relationships. Refer to the table/relationship portion of the block diagram for clarity on table names. Cl-ent is our class table (because class is a restricted word in java) for example.  </a>
