This application is a fully fledged educational tool similar to canvas in functionality. In addition to a class and lecture heirarchy for students, 
we provide a live, collaborative note taking environment for students to use during a professor's lecture. Students may also use our shoutout
tool to anonymously ask the professor questions during lecture, without having to raise their hands. There is also a textbook sharing feature, and
a tool for students to share images of their handwritten notes. These notes can be voted on based upon quality at the discretion of a TA or professor. 
There is also a QR code creator/scanner for professors to give students a QR code so students may scan it and automatically be added to the given class.
